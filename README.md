# Coffee Shop Full Stack

A coffee shop menu application built as part of [Udacity's Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd0044). The application:

1) Display graphics representing the ratios of ingredients in each drink.
2) Allow public users to view drink names and graphics.
3) Allow the shop baristas to see the recipe information.
4) Allow the shop managers to create new drinks and edit existing drinks.

##  Getting Started

### Backend

The `./backend` directory contains a Flask server with a SQLAlchemy module. Auth0 is integrated for authentication.

[View the README.md within ./backend for more details.](./backend/README.md)

### Frontend

The `./frontend` directory implements a Ionic frontend to consume the data from the Flask server.
